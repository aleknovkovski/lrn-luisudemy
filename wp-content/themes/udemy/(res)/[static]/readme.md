**This is the static website provided by Luis**

In this project we're going to build a WordPress theme to match the HTML design provided by Luis.

The design of the static website utilize Tailwind CSS which we will also utilize to build out the WordPress version.

_Note_: I modified the path to CSS on index.html because it was without dot in front and didn't work. The other static html files didn't link to it at all, don't know why. So I added the CSS import line to those myself. The original files provided in the original had html files that don't import the CSS for some weird reason...
